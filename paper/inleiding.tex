\section{Introduction}
  In the modern day, scientists all over the world produce lots of data.
  Even though lots of work can be processed by computers, the amount of
  unprocessed work keeps increasing. It is possible to let supercomputers
  keep up with all the data, however this is expensive and not everbody has
  acces to these kind of machines. Therefore grid-networks are widely used.\\
  \\
  There are many ways to set up grids, and many ways to see what the grid
  has to offer in terms of resources. This review paper looks at some of
  the most recent research done in resource discovery. Two different types of
  new algorithms are discussed. Finally a special resource discovery method,
  made especially for social media is reviewed.
