\section{Tree bitmap}
  This algorithm proposes to use a hierarchic way for resource discovery,
  using a tree structure with bitmaps to represent resource information. 
  All the information and attributes of a resource are transformed into bitmap
  representations. The algorithm makes a difference between Quantitative 
  attributes and Qualitative attributes. Quantitative represent attributes 
  like memory size or CPU speed. For all these attributes a best fit must be
  found, so that all users do not interfere with each other’s requests. 
  The Qualitative represents attributes like the Operating System or 
  number of machines.
